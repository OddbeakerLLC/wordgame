Icon Generation Required
========================

To complete the PWA setup, you need to generate PNG icons:

Quick Method:
1. Open tools/generate-icons.html in your browser
2. Click "Download 192x192" and save to public/icon-192.png
3. Click "Download 512x512" and save to public/icon-512.png

The app will work without these, but won't be installable until the icons are added.

See docs/PWA.md for more details and alternative methods.
